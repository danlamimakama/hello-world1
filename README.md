My self thought written projects

Hello! I like programming and enjoys developing softwares using both frontend and backend technologies. Also, i have good interest in working with data, that is why i enjoy database alot from creation, manipulation and doing stuffs on it. Recently, analysing data to help businesses and for development have open my eyes to the world of data science, because it has come to stay and will be around for a long time. I love everything computing and he endless opprotunity it has and with regard to the changes it can bring to us especially the developing and third world countries.
